permutations = (r!)

permutations with duplicates
numbers = n;
duplicates = 1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3,3
d1(1) = 2 //freq of 1
d2(2) = 3 //freq of 2
d3(3) = 4 //freq of 3
final formula

n!/(d1!*d2!*d3!)

simply total fact divide by product of all freq factorials



combinations = (n!)/((n-r)!*r!)

number of unique permutation of r in n numbers

permutations * combinations 
n!/(n-r)!
